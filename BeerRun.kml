<td>South Carolina does not allow the retail sale of alcohol for off-premise consumption on Sundays. However, counties and cities can permit beer and wine sales if the citizens vote for them in a referendum. Seven counties currently allow Sunday beer and wine sales: Richland, Georgetown, Charleston, Beaufort, Horry, Newberry and York. Cities and towns that have passed laws allowing Sunday beer and wine sales include Columbia, Lexington, Spartanburg, Greenville, Mauldin, Aiken, Rock Hill, Summerville, Santee, Daniel Island, Tega Cay and Walterboro.</td>
